  <p>
    Hi! My name is Julia Brunett, and I recently graduated from Biola University with a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics. 
    I am currently enrolled in a Data Analytics Boot Camp at UC Davis Continuing Education to advance my skills further and to learn new programs 
    that will prepare me for a job in Data Analysis.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    I am passionate about education and using computer software to better understand historical data. In my Boot Camp, I have learned how to code 
    in numerous languages, including Python, VBA, and writing SQL queries.
